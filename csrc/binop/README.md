# Binarized Convolution

Here is the directory that implements a new pytorch operator: Bin1DConv

XNOR-net implemented Bin2dConv here: https://github.com/cooooorn/Pytorch-XNOR-Net

To get this to work with QRNN and ConvSeq2Seq, Bin1DConv needs to be implemented

## TODO

- [ ] Implement Bin1DConv API
- [ ] Define Headers
- [ ] Implement C++ Forward Pass
- [ ] Implement C++ Backward Pass
- [ ] Implement CUDA Forward Pass
- [ ] Implement CUDA Backward Pass
